#About KNN-SMOTE-LSTM
Inspired by Kaggle. Using SMOTE method to make training unbalanced data easier.
Data was too big to upload, but anyone who needs this data can find it on Kaggle by searching 'Creditcard Fraud Detect' or keywords like that.

Also, this is a project from my "Neural Network and Deep Learning" unit. Some bugs may arise because of dimensional problem.
